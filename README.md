# Project:0x11.C-printf

## Introduction:

In this project, we are creating our own printf function. To do this project we must have in mind, all the concepts and resources that have been seen so far. Another thing to consider is the teamwork that must be done and follow the proposed *Framework*.

## Description:

The task **0x11.C-printf** consist in write our own **printf** function, meeting the proposed requirements(see below). We will build a function that can produce terminal outputs of all formats, like printf function also we creates a man page for our own function.

## Requirements:

### General:

+ Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
+ Your programs and functions will be compiled with **gcc 4.8.4** using the flags **-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic**
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A **README.md file**, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
+ Your code should use the **Betty** style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
+ You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ In the following examples, the **main.c** files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own **main.c** files at compilation. Our **main.c** files might be different from the one shown in the examples
+ The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called **holberton.h**
+ Don’t forget to push your header file
+ All your header files should be include guarded
+ Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

### Github

**There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.**

## Installation:

To install the program, the following considerations must be taken in mind:

+ In the folder where it is required to use, all files ending in **.c** must be present.
+ The file with the extension **.h** must be also be present.
+ Before using the program, it is recommended that each file be reviewed, **all of them are properly commented**.
+ For the correct operation of the program, all the files must be inside the folder in which it will be used.

## How to compile it:

To compile the program, the recommended way is typing **gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c** in the folder of your project or you can add all the **.c** files one by one, also adding the printf program files ending in **.c**.

If you need information about the flags of **gcc** you can click this:

- [man 1 gcc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gcc)


## How to use it:

To use the program we give you the function **printf**, the syntax is **_printf([ARGUMENT])**. To make it clearer we leave an example on github to see how it works:

+ [example.c](https://github.com/poix-code/test/blob/master/example.c)

**Note:** to execute, remember use the proposed command above.
